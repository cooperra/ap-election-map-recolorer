# AP election map recolorer

Run this script on an Associated Press election results map to darken the color of counties where candidates have big leads. I find it makes the geographic distribution of votes easier to read.

For example, it works on the map contained here:

Note that you'll have to directly navigate to the iframe contained within, or it won't work. Afterwards, just paste the script into the console [F12] and hit enter.

## AP terms

Note that the AP's policies are not very lenient on reproducing, republishing, or storing their interactive content, so be mindful of that. Use your own judgment. I take no responsibility for your actions or their consequences.
